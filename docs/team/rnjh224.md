## Overview
NoNeck is a command-line module planning application designed for NUS Computer Engineering students to track completed modules and plan their academic journey. It supports personalised user profiles, module tracking, and semester-based planning with persistent storage.

### Enhancements implemented

#### 1. Multi-User Storage System (Core Feature)

I designed and implemented a full multi-user storage architecture, enabling each user to have independent data for modules, planner, and profile.

- Implemented user-specific file paths:
- Integrated storage across:
- Module completion (`Storage`)
- Planner (`PlannerStorage`)
- Profile (`ProfileStorage`)

Example:
- Storage uses: `data/users/<username>/modules.txt`
- PlannerStorage uses: `data/users/<username>/planner.txt`
- ProfileStorage uses: `data/users/<username>/profile.txt`

**Why this is significant:**
- Enables true multi-user support (not originally in Duke)
- Required redesign of storage layer and constructor logic
- Ensures data isolation and persistence per user

---

#### 2. Planner Storage System

Implemented a dedicated `PlannerStorage` class to persist planned modules.

Key features:
- Saves modules with format:
- - Loads planner data into `PlannerList`
- Ensures:
- Directory auto-creation
- Input validation using assertions
- Logging for debugging

**Technical depth:**
- Parsing structured file format safely
- Linking storage to `Module` objects with semester assignment
- Handling corrupted/invalid input using assertions

---

#### 3. Profile Storage System

Implemented `ProfileStorage` to manage user identity and metadata.

Features:
- Stores:
- Username
- GPA
- Validates file format and throws errors for corruption
- Returns `null` for non-existent users (used for control flow)

**Why it matters:**
- Acts as the entry point for user system
- Enables switching users and personalised state
- Handles error cases robustly (invalid format, missing user)

---

#### 4. User Switching Command

Implemented `SwitchUserCommand` to dynamically switch between user profiles.

Features:
- Loads:
- Profile
- Completed modules
- Planner
- Reconstructs application state via `AppState.update(...)`
- Handles:
- Unknown modules
- External modules
- Partial failures with logging

**Why this is complex:**
- Coordinates multiple storage systems together
- Requires careful ordering:
1. Load profile
2. Load modules
3. Load planner
4. Update app state
- Ensures system consistency across components

---

#### 5. Robust Storage Design (Assertions + Logging)

Enhanced reliability of storage layer by:

- Adding assertions:
- Prevent null inputs
- Enforce correct file formats
- Validate modular credits and fields

- Adding logging:
- INFO → file operations
- WARNING → file creation / failures
- FINE → debugging file parsing

**Impact:**
- Prevents silent data corruption
- Improves debugging and maintainability
- Aligns with good SE practices taught in CS2113
